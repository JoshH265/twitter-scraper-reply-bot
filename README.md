# Twitter Scraper/Reply bot

Josh's Basic Twitter Scraper.

Current version of the scaper: You are able to set a search in which you want to scrape. Current example is "Crypto"
This will search the latest tab for all tweets with "crypto" in it. this includes usernames/handles. You can search has tags or more specific tags if you wanted to do that as well. 

Current plan is upgrade search function/figure out a way to make it more efficient and allow more specific searches.

Then look into creating other features such as tracking followers for specific profiles
