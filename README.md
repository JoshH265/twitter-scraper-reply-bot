# Twitter Scraper/Reply bot

Josh's Basic Twitter Scraper.

Current version of the scaper: You are able to set a search in which you want to scrape. Current example is "Crypto"
This will search the latest tab for all tweets with "crypto" in it. this includes usernames/handles. You can search has tags or more specific tags if you wanted to do that as well. 

Current plan is upgrade search function/figure out a way to make it more efficient and allow more specific searches.

Then look into creating other features such as tracking followers for specific profiles

Need to install selenium for it to run

Do not advise using currently unless you know how to debug
